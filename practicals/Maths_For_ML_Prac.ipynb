Now, let's say you have a beam of light (which we'll call a vector from the flashlight to the wall) and a wall (our subspace $U$). You can point your flashlight in any direction, but you want to shine it on the wall in a way that gets it as close as possible to where the beam hits the wall ($\\pi_U(x)$). That's what projection is all about!\n",
