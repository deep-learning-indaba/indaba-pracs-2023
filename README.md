You don't require any previous bio experience, just some basic python, machine learning knowledge and a curious spirit! We will be working with cutting edge techniques in protein langauge modelling, such as using large language models to compute embeddings, how to visualise and explore these embeddings, and finally you will have a chance to train your own model!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

In this prac, we will discuss various principles for responsible AI. We will then concentrate on definitions of fairness. In the first half, we will do an activity to brainstorm definitions of fairness for specific use cases. In the second half, we will implement definitions of fairness per existing literature. We will then discuss and implement methods to improve the fairness outcomes of simple linear models.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

Unfortunately, they are tools that are often disregarded due to their perceived complexity. In this practical we hope to demistify these ideas by building intuition, provided practical tips, and introducing a very powerful framework for embracing the probabilistic approach – probabilistic programming. We’ll both motivate why we need probabilistic programming and give an introduction for using it in practice. <br /> <br /> This prac is aimed at all knowledge levels! No matter what your prior experience with probabilistic thinking and/or programming, we are sure that you will be able to take away some useful knowledge from this practical. However, this means that depending on your level, some of the content will not be aimed at you. Don’t worry, this will be clearly marked at all points.

Basic literacy in mathematics is essential for any machine learning scientist and fluency is often necessary for understanding or advancing the state of the art. In this practical we focus on linear algebra, providing separate tracks for those at the beginner and intermediate levels. This practical will equip you to understand the vast majority of the linear algebra used in machine learning code and papers, and provide you with the basic skills to do derivations and computations of your own. <br /> <br /> In the beginner track we give an introduction to the basics of vectors and matrices, as well as an introduction to inner products and norms. The beginner track concludes by applying the techniques we’ve learned to derive the solution for ridge regression, a commonly used method for linear prediction with regularization. The intermediate track covers projections, orthonormal bases, the determinant, the trace, eigenvalues and eigenvectors. The intermediate track concludes by applying the techniques to principal component analysis, a very common method for dimensionality reduction. Whether you’re taking the beginner or intermediate track (or both!), we hope you find this practical useful! |

Extreme climate events such as droughts, floods, storms, and heatwaves have led to food insecurity and poverty. On the other hand, satellite imagery and machine learning (ML) can help address climate related challenges in food and water security, biodiversity, energy, and public health. To this end, this practical is designed to provide an introductory tutorial on geospatial machine learning for agriculture, particularly to classify farm-level crop types in Kenya using Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. Starting with an introductory session on key concepts of geospatial ML, the tutorial delves into ML development, validation, and performance evaluation techniques. Moreover, we aim to kick-start a build-up of an African GeoAI community that strives and collaborates to solve related challenges in the continent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
